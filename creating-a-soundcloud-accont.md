2. In the Connect with SoundCloud Sing up box, enter your info \(using an active non-uwm email address\). Click Sign up. Create a Soundcloud username and enter your date of birth. You can also use a Facebook or Google account to sign in, but creating a unique SoundCloud account is recommended.
3. Verify your email address by logging into your email account and clicking a confirmation link. \(You will not be able to upload audio to SoundCloud until you verify your email address.\)
4. After verifying your email address, you will need to log out of SoundCloud and log back in again before you can upload audio.
